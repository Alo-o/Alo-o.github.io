     <h2>[Junior, Graphic Design]</h2>
     <p>[I hope to be able to learn a lot about coding and be able to apply my new knowledge to future projects and for future projects.]</p>
     <p>[I love designing all sorts of things with new techniques and being able to refine them with practice. I enjoy watching tutorials and being taught how to be able to do something I already knew in a more efficient way. The best thing is being able to take real life things,as things I do and see day to day, and being able to create something of what I like that others can relate to as well as learning more about this.]</p>
     <p>[For my final project, I hope to be able to create something interactive and fun. Perhaps something having to do with skateboarding.]</p>
