					<h1> Alondra Armijo Morales </h1>
						<h2> Graphic Designer </h2>
							<p> Hello! My name is Alondra Armijo Morales, born and raised in
								Carolina, Puerto Rico. Art has always been a passion of mine but
								my love for the graphic design world was one I found in my early
								teens. I moved to Boston, MA to be able to get a Bachelorâ€™s
								Degree in Graphic Design and a minor in Computer Science. The
								digital communication world fascinates me and I can only hope
								that my knowledge of it keeps growing; with my acquired skills I
								wish to communicate to the world with clear typography and
								great design in my own way.</p>
